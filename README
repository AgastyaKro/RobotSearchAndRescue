# Robot Search and Rescue

A decentralized multi-robot simulation in Webots where autonomous agents search an apartment for a hidden target using only short-range, face-to-face communication.

## Overview

This project simulates a team of ground robots (Khepera IV) tasked with finding and rescuing a color-coded object (a pink box) within a virtual apartment. The robots can **only communicate when nearby**, mimicking real-world communication constraints in search and rescue missions.

The mission is considered complete when **at least 4 robots gather around the target**, and all robots successfully regroup.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Coordination:** Robots share information only through direct encounters, with no global communication or centralized control.
- **Multiple Search Strategies:** Includes implementations of pair-based scouting, quadrant sweeps, timed meetups, and indirect information transfer.
- **Target Verification:** Requires a threshold of 4 robots near the object to confirm a successful discovery.
- **Shared Coordinate System:** Enables all robots to refer to target and meetup locations consistently.
- **Visual Feedback:** Robots visibly react to discoveries and coordinate movement toward the meetup location.

## Environment

- **Simulator:** Webots
- **Robot Model:** Khepera IV
- **World:** `complete_apartment.wbt`
- **Target Object:** `Solid` node (pink box with diffuse color: `0.8 0 0.8`)
